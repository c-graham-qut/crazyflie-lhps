# Lighthouse Positioning System (LhPS) Flying Area
## Introduction
This repository was created to track the development and documentation of a micro-drone flying area utilising Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0 Drones and the Lighthouse Positioning System. The flying area, and supported example programs, are intended to be used for research and STEM education and was created for the Queensland University of Technology as part of my EGH400 Honours project.

This is also intended to act as a personal central hub for all information regarding the LhPS - documenting personal experiences with the system as well as rewording and fusing togther official documentation. All official Bitcraze documentation can be found referenced throughout.
